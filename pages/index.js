      History of food delivery and how its changed To order takeout from your
      favorite restaurant from an app on your phone may seem like a distinctly
      modern phenomenon. But food delivery has a history that extends far
      further back than the smartphone era. A pair of Italian royals in the 19th
      century are widely considered to be the first pizza delivery customers.
      And in the 130 years since that fateful time, the history of food delivery
      has largely mirrored broader historical trends. Wars, technological
      advances, and shifting forms of labor and work have all played a role in
      determining how and when people order food to be delivered. What’s on the
      horizon for food delivery? Only time will tell, but one clue may be found
      in the increasing number of people who are interested in nutrition, and
      how the food that they eat influences the way they feel. Thistle compiled
      a list of 10 major milestones in the history of food delivery using
      primary and secondary historical sources. Click through for a look at how
      food delivery has evolved over the past 130 years. Looking to add

      1889: The first pizza is delivered In 1889, the first pizza delivery took
      place in—where else? Italy. King Umberto and Queen Margherita received the
      delivery. The pie in question came from the famous Pizzeria di Pietro e
      Basta Così. The Naples-based shop had created a new style of pizza, and
      wanted to make sure the royals got a chance to try it. So, when the king
      and queen came to the city, head chef Raffaele Esposito delivered it to
      them personally. Well over a century later, pizza is a mainstay of the
      delivery food ecosphere, from royals to commoners alike. 1890s: Dabbawalas
      deliver lunch to workers in India In the 1890s, a food delivery system
      called dabbawala, or “one who carries the box,” sprang up in colonial
      India. Instead of going home for lunch, or leaving their job sites for
      food, the dabbawalas bring home-cooked lunches to workers directly in
      boxes collected from them. Dabbawala originated in Mumbai, and has since
      spread to other cities. And while the essential concept remains the same,
      dabbawala has evolved with the times to remain relevant today. Workers
      today can request lunches and put in orders through text or an app. 1922:
      Chinese food delivery arrives in America Chinese food delivery made its
      debut in America in 1922. The Los Angeles cafe Kin-Chu called itself the
      “only place on the West Coast making and delivering real Chinese food.”
      The restaurant made use of the relatively new technology of telephones to
      fulfill orders. Customers could call to place an order, and the restaurant
      would deliver as late as 1 a.m. Almost a century later, Chinese food is a
      popular option for delivery, particularly during the holidays, when other
      restaurants may opt to close. DID YOU KNOW? Swapping in one plant-based

      Restaurant food delivery takes off The popularization of television in the
      1950s played a large role in the postwar boom of restaurant food delivery.
      With televisions in more and more homes, the concept of eating dinner from
      restaurants at home was established. Families could come home after long
      days at work and have their meals delivered to enjoy while watching their
      favorite television programs. This was particularly helpful for many
      families as the suburbs grew in popularity, and car ownership surged.
      People no longer necessarily lived nearby their favorite restaurants, and
      cars made delivery more convenient. Eager to capitalize on the trend, many
      restaurants even developed “television dinner” menus. 1954: Meals on
      Wheels launches A new kind of food delivery was born when Meals on Wheels
      launched in 1954. The charity developed in Great Britain in response to
      the economic decline following World War II. Meals on Wheels delivered
      prepared food to homebound people who might not otherwise have access to
      food. The organization soon spread to other countries, including the
      United States. Meals on Wheels is still active today, delivering food to
      the homebound in cities around the world. 1960s: Delivery speed improves
      Thanks in part to the newfound ubiquity of cars, delivery times dropped in
      the 1960s. On the forefront of this innovation were the founders of
      Domino’s pizza. They developed a guarantee that pizza would be with
      clients within 30 minutes or less. The company would later be sued over
      this guarantee. Lawsuits claimed that 30 minutes was such a short delivery
      window that the company was encouraging unsafe driving. 1994: Pizza Hut
      launches Pizzanet In 1994, Pizza Hut debuted one of the earliest web-based
      food delivery sites. Pizzanet didn’t work across the country, but rather
      only for people located in Santa Cruz, California. Regardless, it provided
      an early model for digital food delivery. It was also one of the first
      public sites on the internet. With this in mind, pizza was most likely one
      of the first goods bought and sold online. 1995: World Wide Waiter goes
      online In 1995, the first online restaurant delivery service launched.
      Called World Wide Waiter, the service aggregated more than 60 restaurants
      in the San Francisco Bay Area, and offered home or office delivery. One of
      the founders had surprising motivation for starting the company: While
      convenience and time-saving were nice, he said ordering food to his specs
      is what gave him the idea for World Wide Waiter. “I liked to order
      sandwiches made in a particular way,” he told a local newspaper at the
      time. “It occurred to me that specific orders by computers would be best.”
      2000s: Food delivery goes mainstream In the 2000s, food delivery exploded
      in popularity. As smartphones became even more popular, food delivery apps
      came to dominate delivery services. Office workers could order food from
      their phones to the office without having to step away from their desks,
      and people who decided they’d rather not cook after work could have dinner
      solved with a few taps on their phones. New food delivery apps have been
      continually introduced since the early 2000s. Some specialize in upscale
      takeout from high-end restaurants, which helped some restaurants stay
      afloat during the pandemic. 2010s: Meal kit delivery revolutionizes
      eating-in In the 2010s, meal kits and ready-made meals made their way into
      many home kitchens. Some specialized in delivering all the ingredients for
      a meal to customers who might want to try their hand at cooking something
      new in the kitchen, but were intimidated by grocery shopping. Still others
      help consumers stick to speciality diets. This can give aspiring chefs
      inspiration for cooking future meals on their own, and can help people get
      used to a new diet without any of the legwork or stress that can go into
      learning a new way of cooking. LEARN MORE
